  description:
    "My journey has been fueled by a love for mathematics, science, and the limitless potential of artificial intelligence. I hold a distinguished first-class honors degree in Electrical Engineering. ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing AI applications to revolutionize health care, diagnostics, and treatment methodologies.ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research centered around transformer architectures, image segmentation, and generative models.âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not immersed in the world of AI, you can find me engrossed in amazing books like The Bible, Thinking Fast, and Slow, Movies have a special place in my heart, especially those that bring true stories to life on the big screen. I cherish my quiet moments, during which I ponder the vast tapestry of past and future possibilities. Exploring the fate of the world and its intricate complexities fuels my curiosity and creativity.",
